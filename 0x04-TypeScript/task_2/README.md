# Task 2 - Advanced Types and Functions

This task demonstrates advanced TypeScript features including string literal types, union types, type predicates, and function overloading.

## Features

- DirectorInterface and TeacherInterface with specific methods
- Director and Teacher classes implementing their respective interfaces
- createEmployee function returning union types based on salary
- isDirector type predicate function
- executeWork function with conditional logic
- String literal types for subjects
- teachClass function with type-safe parameters

## Implementations

- Union types (Director | Teacher)
- Type predicates (employee is Director)
- String literal types ("Math" | "History")
- Function overloading and conditional returns
- Class implementations of interfaces

## Files

- `js/main.ts` - Complete TypeScript implementation
- `package.json` - Project dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `webpack.config.js` - Build configuration

## Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
